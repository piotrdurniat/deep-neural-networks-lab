Efektem prac będzie sieć rekurencyjna do predykcji kursu kryptowaluty Bitcoin (BTC) w oparciu o dane z giełdy oraz o wyniki analizy emocji komunikatów z mediów społecznościowych, do których również należy utworzyć dedykowany model sieci rekurencyjnej. Plan realizacji etapów wygląda następująco:\n","\n","1.  EmoTweet - model sieci rekurencyjnej do analizy emocji (10 pkt., laboratorium 10)\n","2.  Agregacja informacji emotywnej i przygotowanie MultiBTC - multimodalnego model sieci rekurencyjnej do predykcji kursu BTC (10 pkt., laboratorium 11)\n","3.  Ewaluacja modelu MultiBTC (10 pkt., laboratorium 12)\n","\n","Łącznie można otrzymać 30 punktów.\n","\n","# Cel ćwiczenia\n","\n","Celem drugiego etapu prac jest przygotowanie modelu MultiBTC sieci rekurencyjnej LSTM do przewidywania kolejnego elementu sekwencji pod warunkiem wcześniejszych obserwacji. Dopuszczalne jest rozwiązanie, które działa podobnie jak klasyfikator z poprzedniego zadania, przy czym w tym wypadku skonstruowany zostanie regresor, a zmienną predykowaną będzie np. średni kurs w następnym dniu pod warunkiem obserwacji z dni poprzednich.\n","\n","# Warunki zaliczenia\n","\n","Do zaliczenia drugiego etapu należy wykonać następujące kroki:\n","\n","1.  Klasyfikacja zbioru tweetów przy pomocy 2 modeli EmoTweet opracowanych w etapie nr 1 (gdyby sieci LSTM były zbyt wolne, można użyć modeli opartych o fastText).\n","2.  Przygotowanie modelu LSTM, dla którego każdy element sekwencji będzie multimodalny, tj. będzie opisany cechami pochodzącymi z różnych źródeł:\n","\n","- Dane z giełdy kryptowalutowej\n","- Zagregowane wartości emocji z tweetów\n","\n","# Zbiór tweetów\n","\n","Zbiór tweetów pochodzi z serwisu [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) i jest podzbiorem 2 milionów wiadomości dotyczących [Bitcoina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) z okresu od stycznia 2018 do maja 2020 roku.\n","\n","## Pobranie\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"fDIg9uknCPNB"},"outputs":[],"source":["# należy wgrać plik z katalogu \"dane\" o nazwie bitcoin_tweets_2M.csv.7z"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PBhdgzc0DgxD"},"source":["## Rozpakowanie\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"id":"NRbstO0FDWvR"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\n","7-Zip (a) [64] 16.02 : Copyright (c) 1999-2016 Igor Pavlov : 2016-05-21\n","p7zip Version 16.02 (locale=en_US.UTF-8,Utf16=on,HugeFiles=on,64 bits,16 CPUs AMD Ryzen 7 4700U with Radeon Graphics          (860F01),ASM,AES-NI)\n","\n","Scanning the drive for archives:\n","  0M Sca        1 file, 97590055 bytes (94 MiB)\n","\n","Extracting archive: bitcoin_tweets_2M.csv.7z\n","--\n","Path = bitcoin_tweets_2M.csv.7z\n","Type = 7z\n","Physical Size = 97590055\n","Headers Size = 146\n","Method = LZMA2:24\n","Solid = -\n","Blocks = 1\n","\n","      3% -

Należy zapamiętać ten model, którego jakość była najlepsza na zbiorze walidacyjnym i na tym modelu dopiero robić ostateczną ewaluację z wykorzystaniem zbioru testowego. Proszę obserwować proces uczenia. Spadek jakości na zbiorze walidacyjnym w dalszych epokach uczenia (po wcześniejszym wzrastaniu w poprzednich epokach) może oznaczać, że model przeuczył się na zbiorze uczącym i można przerwać trenowanie. Często definiuje się w tym celu dodatkowy parametr tzw. **cierpliwości** (ang. patience), który określa, przez ile epok możemy kontynuować uczenie bez otrzymania wyniki lepszego niż dotychczasowy najlepszy.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import fasttext"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Stwórz dataloader\n","\n","\n","def create_loader(\n","    TEXT_PATH: str,\n","    LABELS_PATH: str,\n","    MODEL_PATH: str = \"fasttext_tweetmodel_btc_sg_100_en.bin\",\n","    batch_size: int = 64,\n","):\n","\n","    model = fasttext.load_model(MODEL_PATH)\n","\n","    with open(TEXT_PATH, \"r\") as file:\n","        data = file.read()\n","    lines = data.split(\"\\n\")\n","    if lines[-1] == \"\":\n","        lines = lines[:-1]\n","    texts = pd.DataFrame(lines)\n","\n","    representations = [\n","        torch.tensor(\n","            [model.get_word_vector(word) for word in fasttext.tokenize(texts[0][i])]\n","        )\n","        for i in range(len(texts))\n","    ]\n","    X = pad_sequence(representations, batch_first=True, padding_value=0.0)\n","\n","    labels = pd.read_csv(LABELS_PATH, sep=\"\\t\", header=None).to_numpy()\n","    y = torch.tensor(labels).squeeze(1)\n","\n","    loader = DataLoader(TensorDataset(X, y), batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)\n","    return loader"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":16,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import torch.nn as nn\n","import torch\n","\n","\n","class LSTMModel(nn.Module):\n","\n","    def __init__(\n","        self,\n","        input_size: int,\n","        hidden_size: list[int],\n","        output_size: int,\n","        n_layers: int,\n","        dropout: float = 0.2,\n","    ):\n","        super().__init__()\n","        self.hidden_size = hidden_size\n","        self.n_layers = n_layers\n","        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(\n","            input_size,\n","            self.hidden_size[0],\n","            self.n_layers,\n","            batch_first=True,\n","            dropout=dropout,\n","        )\n","        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)\n","        if len(hidden_size) > 1:\n","            linears = [\n","                nn.Linear(self.hidden_size[i], self.hidden_size[i + 1])\n","                for i in range(len(self.hidden_size) -
