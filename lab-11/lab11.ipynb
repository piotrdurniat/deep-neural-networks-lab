Efektem prac będzie sieć rekurencyjna do predykcji kursu kryptowaluty Bitcoin (BTC) w oparciu o dane z giełdy oraz o wyniki analizy emocji komunikatów z mediów społecznościowych, do których również należy utworzyć dedykowany model sieci rekurencyjnej. Plan realizacji etapów wygląda następująco:\n","\n","1.  EmoTweet - model sieci rekurencyjnej do analizy emocji (10 pkt., laboratorium 10)\n","2.  Agregacja informacji emotywnej i przygotowanie MultiBTC - multimodalnego model sieci rekurencyjnej do predykcji kursu BTC (10 pkt., laboratorium 11)\n","3.  Ewaluacja modelu MultiBTC (10 pkt., laboratorium 12)\n","\n","Łącznie można otrzymać 30 punktów.\n","\n","# Cel ćwiczenia\n","\n","Celem drugiego etapu prac jest przygotowanie modelu MultiBTC sieci rekurencyjnej LSTM do przewidywania kolejnego elementu sekwencji pod warunkiem wcześniejszych obserwacji. Dopuszczalne jest rozwiązanie, które działa podobnie jak klasyfikator z poprzedniego zadania, przy czym w tym wypadku skonstruowany zostanie regresor, a zmienną predykowaną będzie np. średni kurs w następnym dniu pod warunkiem obserwacji z dni poprzednich.\n","\n","# Warunki zaliczenia\n","\n","Do zaliczenia drugiego etapu należy wykonać następujące kroki:\n","\n","1.  Klasyfikacja zbioru tweetów przy pomocy 2 modeli EmoTweet opracowanych w etapie nr 1 (gdyby sieci LSTM były zbyt wolne, można użyć modeli opartych o fastText).\n","2.  Przygotowanie modelu LSTM, dla którego każdy element sekwencji będzie multimodalny, tj. będzie opisany cechami pochodzącymi z różnych źródeł:\n","\n","- Dane z giełdy kryptowalutowej\n","- Zagregowane wartości emocji z tweetów\n","\n","# Zbiór tweetów\n","\n","Zbiór tweetów pochodzi z serwisu [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) i jest podzbiorem 2 milionów wiadomości dotyczących [Bitcoina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) z okresu od stycznia 2018 do maja 2020 roku.\n","\n","## Pobranie\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"id":"fDIg9uknCPNB"},"outputs":[],"source":["# należy wgrać plik z katalogu \"dane\" o nazwie bitcoin_tweets_2M.csv.7z"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PBhdgzc0DgxD"},"source":["## Rozpakowanie\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"id":"NRbstO0FDWvR"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["/bin/bash: line 1: 7za: command not found\n"]}],"source":["!7za x bitcoin_tweets_2M.csv.7z"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DJ3MmCixDpER"},"source":["## Zawartość\n","\n","Dane zawierają następujące kolumny:\n","\n","- `timestamp` - data wysłania wiadomości\n","- `likes` - liczba polubień wiadomości\n","- `retweets` - liczba przekazań dalej wiadomości\n","- `username` - nick użytkownika\n","- `text` - tekst tweeta \"zanonimizowany\" przy pomocy metody [`preprocess`](https://github.com/cardiffnlp/tweeteval/blob/main/TweetEval_Tutorial.ipynb), która była użyta przy tworzeniu zbioru [TweetEval](https://github.com/cardiffnlp/tweeteval)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["/home/piotr/projects/ai/gsn-l/lab-11\n"]}],"source":["# for server\n","import os\n","\n","# os.chdir(\"/home\")\n","\n","# for local\n","\n","print(os.getcwd())"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":73,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":419},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":9389,"status":"ok","timestamp":1620160488475,"user":{"displayName":"Jan Kocoń","photoUrl":"","userId":"12977978142372414049"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"RY-fh5UxFoeG","outputId":"f4ba59d4-4850-493d-80e0-6404bac6699c"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>timestamp</th>\n","      <th>likes</th>\n","      <th>retweets</th>\n","      <th>username</th>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>2018-01-01 00:00:03</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>ANDRO1711</td>\n","      <td>From the future of bitcoin to Facebook, 2018 i...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>2018-01-01 00:00:04</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>BitcoinAverage - Cryptocurrency Exchange Rates</td>\n","      <td>BitcoinAverage - bitcoin price index - ($ 1394...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>2018-01-01 00:00:09</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Jimmyhoshi</td>\n","      <td>Singapore bar offers bitcoin New Year party pa...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>2018-01-01 00:00:16</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>BTC Bros</td>\n","      <td>how the Chinese bitcoin market collapsed in 20...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>2018-01-01 00:00:26</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>SBIYP</td>\n","      <td>Cryptocurrency Craze!

Należy zapamiętać ten model, którego jakość była najlepsza na zbiorze walidacyjnym i na tym modelu dopiero robić ostateczną ewaluację z wykorzystaniem zbioru testowego. Proszę obserwować proces uczenia. Spadek jakości na zbiorze walidacyjnym w dalszych epokach uczenia (po wcześniejszym wzrastaniu w poprzednich epokach) może oznaczać, że model przeuczył się na zbiorze uczącym i można przerwać trenowanie. Często definiuje się w tym celu dodatkowy parametr tzw. **cierpliwości** (ang. patience), który określa, przez ile epok możemy kontynuować uczenie bez otrzymania wyniki lepszego niż dotychczasowy najlepszy.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## 1.
